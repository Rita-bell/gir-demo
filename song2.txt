In The Flesh?"
So ya
Thought ya
Might like to go to the show.
To feel the warm thrill of confusion
That space cadet glow.
Tell me is something eluding you sunshine?
Is this not what you expected to see?
If you wanna to find out what's behind these cold eyes?
You'll just have to claw your way through this
Disguise 

The Thin Ice"
Momma loves her baby 
And Daddy loves you too 
And the sea may look warm to you Babe 
And the sky may look blue 
Ooooh Babe 
Ooooh Baby Blue 
Ooooh Babe 
If you should go skating 
On the thin ice of modern life 
Dragging behind you the silent reproach 
Of a million tear stained eyes 
Don't be surprised, when a crack in the ice 
Appears under your feet 
You slip out of your depth and out of your mind 
With your fear flowing out behind you 
As you claw the thin ice
